The 3D models in the repository are of this prototype, which was made with several off the shelf parts in a protoboard. They are there for archival purposes only.

### Project Progress
- [x] Build A Prototype.
- [x] Find Sensor With Enough Range.
  > Currently deciding between BH1680 and BH1751.
- [x] Find another cheaper microcontroller.
  > Decided on the ATMega328P-AU due to it's popularity.
- [ ] Design Version 1.0 Handheld PCB.
- [ ] Write full firmware.
- [ ] Design Hot-Shoe Mounted Alternative.
- [ ] Add Incident Metering To Handheld Model.
