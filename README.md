# lightmeter-32u4
An analog photography centered light meter based on a TEMT6000 ambient light sensor running off an Arduino Pro Micro [ATmega32U4].

### Current iteration: Prototype 0.1

### To do:
* Find a way to measure more than ~1000 lux with the sensor.
* Implement Shutter Priority mode.
* Make it so measured value does not change when changing ISO.
