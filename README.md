# lightmeter-32u4
An analog photography centered light meter based on a TEMT6000 ambient light sensor running off an Arduino Pro Micro [ATmega32U4].

### Current iteration: Prototype 0.1

### Project Progress
- [x] Build A Prototype.
- [x] Implement Aperture Priority Mode.
- [ ] Implement Shutter Priority Mode.
- [ ] Design PCB.
- [ ] Build Credit Card Sized Lightmeter

### Known Issues
* Find a way to measure more than ~1000 lux with the sensor.
* Make it so measured value does not change when changing ISO.
